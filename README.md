# Capstone Project 1
Kiva loan delay analysis treating it as a classification problem.

---
### Goal of the project:
Understand what may cause a higher delay between:
* the "posted time" (the time at which the loan is posted on Kiva by the field agent)
* the "funded time" (the time at which the loan posted to Kiva gets 100% funded by lenders)
* the "disbursed time" (the time at which the loan is disbursed by the field agent to the borrower)
